# ERC1155-integration
ERC1155 for multi-token minting from a single contract under Replatform umbrella

## Improvements
The original Replatform Token was a single ERC20 token doing the work for multiple token contracts. 
By implementing the ERC1155 token (potentially with some dev defined additions to the OpenZeppelin design implementations), 
we should be able to make a multi-token contract that permits communities to pull from a pre-defined pool of token to dedicate 
to their specific community.
